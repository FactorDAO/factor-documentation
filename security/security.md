## **Audit Overview and History**

Factor's commitment to security is evidenced by our consistent and thorough auditing process:

* **Q3 2023 Strategy Audits by Sourcehat (formerly Solidity Finance)**:
  * Conducted in-depth audits of various strategies for the V2 vaults, including GLPStrategy, LodestarStrategy, MuxStrategy, TraderJoeStrategy.
  * Additional strategies like PendleStrategy, PerennialStrategy, RedactedStrategy, and more were also audited.
* **Q2 2023 V2 Yield Vaults Audits**:
  * Focused on the V2 yield vault architecture, which included contract like FactorVault, FactorVaultMulti, FactorVaultManager, and FactorVaultMultiManager.
* **Q1 2023 Initial Audits by Sourcehat / Solidity Finance**:
  * Covered foundational contracts such as VaultGenesis, the FCTR token, BasketVault (1st gen vault architecture), and veFCTR contracts (staking).

**Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response**

* **Chainalysis' Crypto Incident Response**: Beyond audits, Factor's smart contracts are under continuous surveillance by Chainalysis via Hyperledger's AI-driven technology. This proactive monitoring approach is crucial for early detection and mitigation of potential threats. In the event of an exploit, Chainalysisâ€™ Global Response Team will quickly respond to the situation and increase the chances of asset recovery.
