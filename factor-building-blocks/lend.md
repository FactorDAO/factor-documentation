# ➡️ Lend

## Overview

The Lend Building Block facilitates collateralized lending management across multiple DeFi lending protocols. By facilitating easy deposits into lending pools as part of an automated multi-protocol strategy, the Lend Building Block enables depositors to earn lending interest while getting access to collateralized borrowing. This means even greater capital efficiency for strategies built on Factor Studio.

With integrations across multiple lending protocols, lenders are free to choose between their preferred protocols, tokens, and strategies without worrying about specific protocol differences. The Lend Building Block allows lenders to easily access more liquidity while offsetting the opportunity costs of [HODL](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp)ing their favourite tokens.

## Features

* **Earn Supply Interest:** Deposit your tokens into a lending pool and start earning a supply interest which is paid by borrowers of your tokens. The interest earned is dynamic and responds to the market in real time. The greater the demand, the higher the lending pool utilization, and the higher the supply interest.
* **Capital Access & Efficiency:** By pledging your lent tokens as collateral, you also have the option to borrow against it thereby unlocking more capital that can be used for other purposes.
* **Maintain Token Exposure:** Continue maintaining full exposure to your token as you earn supply interest or borrow against it.
