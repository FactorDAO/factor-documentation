## Overview

Factor Yield Building Block automates yield farming strategies across DeFi AMM liquidity protocols. Through auto-compounding LP returns, the Yield Vault maximizes potential yield while simultaneously minimizing manual overheads (i.e. gas costs, capital rebalancing, etc.). Factor Yield Vaults are permissionless enabling anyone or any organization to deposit tokens and immediately start earning amplified yields without any lockup.

With integrations across multiple liquidity sources, users are able to seamlessly access automated yield farming strategies on their favourite protocols. Factor Yield Vaults support both single and multi-asset strategies. More advanced users can even leverage Factorâ€™s Strategy Builder to build your own strategy without worrying about technical implementation details.

## Features

* **Auto-Compounding Yields:** Yield generated is periodically reinvested thereby maximizing market making capital efficiency.
* **Gas Costs Socialization:** Gas costs incurred when managing the position is distributed across all LPs thereby saving individual LPs gas.
* **Reduced Reward Token Exposure:** As yield farms generally incentivize liquidity by distributing their own reward tokens, the periodic reinvestment into the underlying token pool minimizes exposure to supplementary tokens.
* **Liquidity Protocol Abstraction:** Manage your liquidity positions directly from the Yield Building Block without having to directly interface with the underlying liquidity and yield farming protocols.
