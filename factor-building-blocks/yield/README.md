# ðŸ’¸ Yield

Factor Yield Vaults are advanced DeFi tools that offer users a streamlined and efficient way to earn yields on their assets. These vaults automate the process of earning yields from various protocols on Arbitrum, catering to both single and multi-asset strategies.

### Key Features

**Auto-Compounding**: The vaults' auto-compounding feature ensures that yields are continually compounded, thus amplifying the compounding effect on returns. This automation saves time and maximizes efficiency.

**Diverse Strategies**: Catering to a range of assets and protocols, the vaults offer a diverse set of strategies including but not limited to:

* Lending
* Liquidity Providing
* Liquid Staked Derivatives

**Zap** : convert and deposit any asset directly into the yield vaults, all in one-click! This streamlines the process of opening a yielding position.

#### **Integration with Major Protocols**

Factor vaults seamlessly integrate with various leading DeFi protocols, enhancing the range of yield opportunities. Examples include:

* **Penpie: rETH Auto-Compounder:** Integrates with the Penpie and Pendle, consistently generating high yields on rETH
* **GMX GLP Auto-Compounder**: Integrates with the GMX protocol and maximizes yield on GLP
* **MUX MUXLP Auto-Compounder**: Leverages the MUX protocol to optimize yields on staked MUXLP
* **Trader Joe Auto-Compounder**: Targets Trader Joe's JOE tokens, tapping into the yield offered by their sJOE pool
* **Silo Strategies**: Incorporates Silo's isolated lending pools for sUSDC-ARB and sUSDC-GMX

### How They Work

1. **Deposit**: Users deposit their assets into a specific yield vault. The type of assets accepted depends on the vault's strategy.

3. **Compounding Returns**: Earned yields are automatically compounded, enhancing the overall return for users over time.
4. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw their assets, along with the accrued yields, according to their needs and timing.
