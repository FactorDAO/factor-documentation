# ðŸ¥© Stake

## Overview

The Stake Building Block enables liquidity provision strategies to gain access to yield farming rewards across various DeFi protocols. Strategies which market make on AMM DEXs (via the [LP Management Building Block](lp-management/)) can stake their liquidity position to earn additional ecosystem liquidity incentives and rewards.&#x20;

Liquidity Providers are free to choose between their preferred protocols, pools, and strategies without worrying about specific protocol differences. The Stake Building Block ensures that LPs do not miss out on any yield farming opportunities and can continue earning long term liquidity incentives for their liquidity contributions.
