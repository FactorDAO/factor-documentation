# Take Out A Loan

### Starting with One-Click Looping

1. **Pair Selection**: Choose the asset you wish to leverage, and the asset you wish to provide as collateral. The UI also allows you to filter by strategy type, protocol, and search for specific assets.

2. **Setting Leverage Level**: Determine the level of leverage you're comfortable with. Remember, higher leverage means higher potential returns but also higher risks.
3. **Activating Looping**: By clicking 'Open Position', the system automatically deposits your selected asset as collateral, borrows against it, and repeats the process until the desired leverage ratio has been achieved.
