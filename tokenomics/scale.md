### What is Factor Scale?

Factor Scale gives veFCTR holders the ability to vote on the allocation of Scale rewards to different vaults created on Factor. Each week, a pool of **100,000 esFCTR** is allocated for Scale rewards, incentivizing active governance participation.

### **Voting Process and Reward Allocation**

veFCTR holders can vote on where the Scale rewards should be directed based on their assessment and preferences. The voting will be weighted, meaning you can allocate votes to several strategies. Example, a holder can allocate 60% of their voting power to one strategy, and the remaining 40% to another.&#x20;

**Epoch and Voting Period**: The voting period extends over 96 hours within a weekly epoch, allowing ample time for stakeholder participation.

**Reward Distribution**: The allocation of the 100,000 esFCTR weekly rewards is determined by the collective voting outcome, reflecting the community's consensus on vault performance and potential. The distribution to depositors is done on a pro-rated basis.

&#x20;Rewards distributed by Scale are vested as esFCTR, which can be converted to FCTR at a 1:1 ratio over a 90-day vesting period.&#x20;
