# ðŸŒ¿ Staking and Governance

Stake FCTR to receive veFCTR, the token that forms the core of Factor's governance. veFCTR holders gain 50% of protocol revenues and governance rights.&#x20;

The veFCTR system rewards longer commitments with an up to 2.5x multiplier on emissions, offering significant boosts on vault incentives for maximum-duration stakers.

Factor will use single choice voting for regular governance processes, and Scale rewards will be directed based on a weighted voting process.

### veFCTR

**Linear veFCTR Decay**: The decay of veFCTR value over time remains linear, ensuring a predictable and transparent reduction in voting power as the lock period progresses.&#x20;

The maximum lock-in period for veFCTR is two years.

**Greater Incentives for Max-Lockers**: Stakers opting for the maximum lock-in duration can now benefit from up to 2.5x multiplier on incentives, significantly increasing returns on both Scale and upcoming Boost mechanisms. In contrast to the stakerâ€™s veFCTR holdings, the linear decay does not apply to the reward multiplier.

### Factor Scale

Factor Scale is a reward distribution mechanism that enables veFCTR holders to vote on yield boost across various vaults.&#x20;
