# ðŸ§± Initial Distribution

This section offers a detailed breakdown of FCTR's token allocation, shedding light on the purpose of each allocation category and the corresponding vesting schedules.

### Fair Launch (10%)

10% of the FCTR tokens were allocated to the fair launch. These were fully unlocked and distributed via Camelot DEX.

### Ecosystem Incentives (20.8%)

20.8% of FCTR tokens are designated for ecosystem incentives, which include strategy creation, growth, protocol owned liquidity (POL), and other incentives within the ecosystem. These tokens are linearly vested over 12 months.

### Community Bootstrapping (4.2%)

The community bootstrapping allocation represented 4.2% of FCTR tokens, priced at $0.05, and subject to a 12 months linear vesting schedule with a 30-day cliff. No tokens were available at Token Generation Event (TGE). This allocation supported smart contract audits, development, legal, and marketing efforts required for the platform's launch.

### Team (15%)

The team allocation amounts to 15% of FCTR tokens and subject to a 24-month vesting period with a 30-day cliff. No team tokens were available at TGE. Note that while team tokens are unvested, they do not accrue veFCTR. To accrue veFCTR, the tokens must be vested, claimed and staked, ensuring fair distribution and rewards for all participants.

### Treasury Reserve (50%)

50% of FCTR tokens are allocated to the Treasury Reserve, which is vested over 4 years. This reserve is used for DAO contributor compensations, DAO-to-DAO token swaps, and any other future needs of the DAO. This allocation helps ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the Factor ecosystem.
