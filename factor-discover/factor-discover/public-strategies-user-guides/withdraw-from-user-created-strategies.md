Removing liquidity is as easy as inputting the amount of liquidity you would like to withdraw via the tab on the top right of the strategy Discover page.

You can select which token you would prefer to receive from the withdrawal based on the Strategy Manager's configuration.&#x20;

The strategy will try to fulfil your token request if there is sufficient unutilized balance in the strategy. In case there is insufficient unutilized balance, the strategy will automatically trigger the exit strategy defined by the Strategy Manager. In such cases, the tokens received will be dependent on the exit strategy but you will always get a proportional share of all the strategy's assets.
