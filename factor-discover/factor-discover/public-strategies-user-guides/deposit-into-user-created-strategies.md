# Deposit Into User Created Strategies

## Overview

Deposit into any user managed strategy with ease via Discover. Anyone can create and manage their own public strategy with [Studio](../../../factor-studio/studio-pro/). As such, when you deposit into a Discover strategy, you're allowing your favourite strategist to manage your funds for you.

**Separation of management & funds**

All strategies created via Studio are non-custodial with a smart contract handling all the deposited liquidity. Strategy Managers are only able to allocate strategy liquidity via the vault and never "own" any of the strategy deposits.

## One-click Deposits Into User Managed Strategies&#x20;

### Step 1: Find Your Optimal Strategy

You can search and filter through a list of community-curated strategies on [Discover Pro](https://pro.factor.fi/).&#x20;

Once you've found your perfect fit, you can select the strategy to open the strategy details.

* Strategy TVL ≥USD 10,000
* Strategy receives ≥10,000 [veFCTR](../../../governance/fctr-token/#vefctr) votes via [Factor Scale](../../../governance/factor-scale/)
* Strategy holds ≥10,000 [FCTR](../../../governance/fctr-token/#fctr)

Click on the "Deposit" button to proceed with the deposit. If this is your first time interacting with the strategy, you will first have to approve the Strategy Contract which enables it to debit the token from your wallet.

Once your transaction has been executed by the network, you will be able to view your updated balance on the Strategy Details page.

**Proof Of Deposit**

When depositing into any Factor strategies, you will receive vault specific tokens which represents your share in the vault. These vault tokens are returned and burned when you withdraw your allocated vault shares (which includes any vault returns/losses).
