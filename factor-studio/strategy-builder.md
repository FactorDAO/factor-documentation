# üèó Strategy Builder

## Overview

The Strategy Builder provides a drag-and-drop canvas where creators can experiment, test, and deploy various strategy combinations. Strategy Builder provides an intuitive interface for users to mix-and-match various Factor Building Blocks without the need to code. With Strategy Builder, users are able to focus on creating actual DeFi strategies while significantly reducing the time to market.

DeFi strategies are only limited by your imagination as Strategy Builder is natively integrated with strategy abstractions ([Factor Building Blocks](../factor-building-blocks/factor-building-blocks.md)) that can seamlessly interface with the rest of the DeFi ecosystem (via [Factor Adapters](../factor-adapters/factor-adapters.md)). This includes operations such as liquidity provision, lending, swaps, etc. Strategy Builder handles the complex tasks of packaging your strategy and executing it on-chain.
