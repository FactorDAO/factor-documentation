# Swap

## Overview

The [Swap Building Block](../../../factor-building-blocks/swap/) functions as an automation and composability layer between the incoming swap request and multiple integrated liquidity protocols. With the Swap Building Block, strategies can easily swap between any ERC20 token thereby creating endless possibilities for multi-token strategies.
