## Overview

Factor Studio enables anyone to create public DeFi strategies in minutes. This means that you can create your own public strategy vault and anyone can then deposit into your vault. Vaults are non-custodial and enables you to manage your depositor's funds without having direct ownership over their tokens.

You can easily create and manage your own vault via the [Studio interface](https://studio.factor.fi/). The guides in this section are meant to help you through the process of getting your public vault to market which involves a few distinct stages:

1. [**Public Strategy Creation**](public-strategy-creation.md)**:** The creation of the main strategy that will be implemented by the vault. This requires the structuring of DeFi building blocks and relevant amounts.
2. [**Making Your Strategy Public**](making-your-strategy-public.md)**:** Once your strategy has been set, you can publicize your vault which enables Depositors to [Discover](broken-reference) and deposit into your vault. This includes setting up various safety parameters and publicly viewable strategy details.
3. [**Strategy Execution**](strategy-execution.md)**:** Covers the ongoing management of strategy funds through adjustment of strategy parameters based on vault balances.
