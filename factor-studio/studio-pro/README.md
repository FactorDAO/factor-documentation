# ðŸ‘¥ Public Strategies

## Overview

Factor Studio enables anyone to create and **share** public DeFi strategies. This paves the way towards an open and permissionless asset management marketplace powered by user-created strategies. From ideation to deposits, Studio ensures anyone can create, distribute, and monetize any DeFi strategy in minutes.

With Studio, Factor introduces Strategy-as-a-Service where all the technical barriers to get a strategy to market is abstracted away:

* **Coding Knowledge:** Drag-and-drop protocols from across DeFi into a single automated strategy.
* **Protocol Specific Functions:** Interact with the same core financial functions across all integrated protocols without having to understand each protocol particulars. DeFi becomes intent based.
* **Operational Overheads:** Aside from a good strategy, running a strategy also incurs secondary overheads such as hosting a user interface, security audits, etc.
* **Fragmented Liquidity:** Value transfer between protocols is no longer bottlenecked by the small number of channels created by a minority of developers that are experts in multiple protocols.

Focus on the strategy, let Studio handle the rest.

## Features

* [x] **Trustless Asset Management:** Strategy factory contracts are [audited](../../security/audits/) while every vault is deployed with safety constraints to keep the strategy manager in check.&#x20;
