# 🏠 Private Strategies

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Private Strategy Support**

To kickstart community-created strategies, support for public strategies have been prioritized to get more users familiar with the permissionless asset management space.

Depending on future demand, support for private strategies can be resumed once a critical mass has been achieved.
