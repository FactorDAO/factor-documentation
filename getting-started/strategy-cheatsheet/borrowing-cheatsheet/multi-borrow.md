Borrow as many different tokens as needed against newly added collateral in a single transaction. Diversify your borrow interest and get access to more borrowing markets in a single multi-token strategy.

## Potential Alpha

* **Diversify Token Borrow Interest:** Spread your single token borrows into multiple markets and diversify your borrow interest and market risks.
* **Diversify Strategy Borrow Interest:** Borrow various tokens from different markets and diversify your borrow interest.
