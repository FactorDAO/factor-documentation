Diversify your lending interest and get access to more lending markets in a single strategy. Chain as many lending blocks as needed to create complex multi-token strategies with varied lending yields.

## Potential Alpha

* **Diversify Token Supply Interest:** Spread your single token deposit into multiple lending markets and diversify your supply interest and market risks.
* **Diversify Strategy Supply Interest:** Deposit various tokens into different markets and diversify your lending interest.
* **Maximize Supply Interest:** Not a single second is wasted as your tokens are immediately added to the target lending pools to earn interest.
