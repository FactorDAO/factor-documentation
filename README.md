## Building The Composable Layer Of DeFi

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Factor_Overview_Venn.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Factor Solutions</p></figcaption></figure>

Factor is realising a future where building and automating complex DeFi strategies are as simple as a drag-and-drop, no coding required. At Factor, we are democratising access to open and permissionless financial rails by equipping users with powerful but intuitive tools that abstracts the intricacies of getting cross-protocol DeFi strategies to market. Factor promotes a thriving DeFi community by empowering users to create shareable strategies that are open to all.

* **Strategy Creators:** Combine varying strategies from multiple DeFi protocols into one automated strategy using [Factor Studio](factor-studio/factor-studio.md)'s drag-and-drop interface.
* **Strategy Managers:** Have what it takes to consistently create successful strategies? Shorten your time to market and earn more fees by allowing users to deposit to your automated strategies.
* **Depositors:** Participate in professionally-managed and community-curated strategies by depositing funds into automated strategy vaults on [Factor Discover](factor-discover/factor-discover/) to earn passive yield.
* **Developers:** Leverage the [Factor SDK](factor-sdk/factor-sdk.md) to effortlessly create custom strategies directly on your app or backend without having to worry about protocol integration specifics.
* **Protocols & DAOs:** Generate permissionless protocol incentives and distribution systems with ease while benefitting from Factor's revenue share or partnership funds.
* **Factorians:** Stake [FCTR](governance/fctr-token/) and participate in building the future of Factor while earning long term protocol incentives.

With integrations across multiple protocols, Factor is a user-friendly and secure gateway to the rest of DeFi. All of Factor's smart contracts are audited by [PeckShield](security/audits/peckshield/) & [SourceHat](security/audits/sourcehat/) with live contracts being [actively monitored by Chainalysis](security/security.md#continuous-monitoring-and-incident-response). Whether you're a protocol, treasury, builder, or individual strategist, Factor streamlines your path to financial autonomy, ensuring a seamless journey for all.

Factor is governed by the [FactorDAO](governance/factordao/), a community-owned platform that empowers [FCTR](governance/fctr-token/#fctr) token holders to participate in the governance of the protocol. By aligning protocol growth with long-term individual incentives, the [FactorDAO](governance/factordao/) places [FCTR](governance/fctr-token/#fctr) holders at the center of Factor‚Äôs future. FactorDAO consensus guides the direction of the Factor team which operates a fully remote ream with \~25 builders spread around the globe.
