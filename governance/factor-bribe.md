# üéÅ Factor Bribe

## Overview

Factor Bribe enables anyone to influence the distribution of [Factor Scale](factor-scale/) rewards through bribing [veFCTR](fctr-token/#vefctr) holders to vote for a specified vault. By bribing Factor Scale voters, **bribers achieve greater capital efficiency as the value of the protocol rewards can potentially outweigh their initial bribe amount**. Being permissionless, Factor Bribe creates a competitive governance bribing market therefore ensuring the best rewards for Factor voters.

Factor Bribe rewards are accumulated in a separate pool with the protocol automatically tracking the distribution of [Factor Scale votes](factor-scale/#voting-process) to calculate the bribe rewards accumulated to a [veFCTR](fctr-token/#vefctr) voter. Bribe rewards are distributed proportionally based on the amount of vote weight each voter allocated to a bribed vault during a specific epoch. Bribe rewards can be claimed upon the completion of the relevant Factor Scale epoch.

Through native integrations, Factor Bribe encourages further governance participation via [Factor Scale](factor-scale/) through permissionless rewards. This not only further spurs decentralization but also strengthens the economic security of the Factor ecosystem by aligning the goals of [FCTR](fctr-token/) voters and bribers.&#x20;

**Bribe Refund**

Do note that in the case that a bribed vault does not receive any votes within the same epoch, the briber is able to withdraw their deposited bribe amount.
