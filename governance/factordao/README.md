# üèõ FactorDAO

## Introduction

We believe that community governance and a robust process will benefit Factor's ecosystem. The DAO will enhance decentralization by having members participate in the protocol's governance and guiding it to new heights.

The community will also be incentivized to grow the protocol's value by expanding its ecosystem with new products, partnerships, as well as research to help the DAO make informed decisions. We want to create a vibrant, research-driven community that benefits anyone interacting with the platform.

## Participating In Factor Governance

DAO members may lock their $FCTR tokens to accumulate $veFCTR - the native, non-transferable governance token, and take part in the DAO‚Äôs governance mechanism by voting and submitting proposals.

Longer lock-up periods result in greater $veFCTR emissions to incentivize long-term involvement within the community. Members who actively participate in the governance process will receive $FCTR as a reward for supporting the decentralization of the DAO.
