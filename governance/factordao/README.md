At the heart of every successful protocol lies a myriad of stakeholders all intricately connected through protocol governance. Here at Factor, we strongly believe that proper governance incentives plays a crucial role in aligning stakeholder goals thereby encouraging more organic and decentralized community governance.&#x20;

**The Factor Flywheel**

The [Factor Flywheel](factor-flywheel.md) condenses all of our learnings and functions as a solid foundation upon which Factor governance can continue to prosper.
{% endhint %}

The FactorDAO facilitates decentralized governance of the protocol through coordinating governance proposals and incentives as determined by governance token holders. This non-exhaustive list includes:

* Staking of [FCTR](../fctr-token/#fctr) in exchange for governance rights and rewards
* Distribution of Factor emission rewards via [Factor Scale](../factor-scale/) as well as liquidity incentives via [Factor Boost](../factor-boost/)
* Supporting an open market for [FCTR](../fctr-token/) through protocol-owned liquidity provision
* Control of the Factor [multisig treasury](factordao-multisig-addresses.md) which accrues protocol revenue and funds various protocol growth initiatives
* DAO token swaps to enhance collaboration between Factor and other protocols
* Contributor compensations and community growth initiatives

As a means to coordinate users in an ever changing environment, governance mechanisms are meant to evolve accordingly hence we invite you to participate in the future of Factor through joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/factor-981676208251088916) or even [becoming a FCTR staker](https://pro.factor.fi/governance/stake).

## Getting Started With Factor Governance

[Stake FCTR](user-guides/stake-fctr.md) to participate in governing Factor and get rewarded in the process:

* [x] 50% protocol revenue share distributed monthly in [FCTR](../fctr-token/#fctr)
* [x] Direct FCTR emissions by voting on [Factor Scale](../factor-scale/)
* [x] Supercharge strategy rewards as all stakers receive up to a 2.5x [emission multiplier](../factor-scale/emission-multiplier-calculations/)
* [x] Participate in [Factor Bribes](../factor-bribe/) and claim voting incentives
* [ ] Submit and vote on governance proposals (_coming soon_)

Visit our [tokenomics section](../fctr-token/) for a deeper dive into how the various incentives are supporting the long-term decentralization of the FactorDAO.
