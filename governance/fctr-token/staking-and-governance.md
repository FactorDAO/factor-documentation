# Staking and Governance

Stake [FCTR](./#fctr) to receive [veFCTR](./#vefctr), the token that forms the core of Factor's governance. By holding [veFCTR](./#vefctr), users get access to a range of ecosystem benefits:

* Eligibility to vote on FactorDAO governance proposals (1[veFCTR](./#vefctr):1vote) and determine the future of the Factor platform
* Power to influence the distribution of emissions rewards via voting for their favourite strategies on [Factor Scale](staking-and-governance.md#factor-scale)
* Revenue sharing perks whereby 50% of Factor platform revenue is automatically disbursed as [FCTR](./#fctr) to [veFCTR](./#vefctr) holders

FactorDAO's staking design rewards longer term commitments via leveraging both a staking multiplier as well as an emissions multiplier. The staking multiplier enables [FCTR](./#fctr) stakers to receive up to a maximum of 1[veFCTR](./#vefctr):1[FCTR](./#fctr) by staking for the max duration of 2 years, subject to time-based linear decay of the staking duration. The emissions multiplier rewards longer term stakers by introducing a 2.5x multiplier which is subject to the staking duration, proportion of veFCTR holdings, and strategy liquidity contributions. More info regarding the multipliers can be found on the [veFCTR](./#vefctr) explainer.

Factor will use single choice voting for regular governance processes while [Factor Scale](../factor-scale/) rewards will be directed based on a weighted voting process.
