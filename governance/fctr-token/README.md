# ðŸª™ FCTR Token

## Overview

Our project's success hinges on the Factor community. We firmly believe in acknowledging and incentivizing early community members and contributors to the protocol as a way to promote adoption and decentralization.

We are dedicated to ensuring Factor's long-term sustainability, which is evident in our tokenomics. These tokenomics provide compelling rewards that spur the growth and evolution of a resilient platform, guided by an actively involved community.

### **Ethos**

Factor operates based on principles of fairness, community involvement, and sustainable development. These core values are mirrored in our tokenomics model, which has been carefully designed to emphasize the equitable distribution of the majority of $FCTR tokens directly to our community. This approach empowers our community members to actively participate in governing our protocol, ensuring their central role in decision-making processes.

### **Max Supply Cap and No Inflation**

**Factor maintains a maximum supply of $FCTR tokens, set at 100,000,000, with no emissions beyond this limit.** This approach ensures there are no inflationary mechanisms or unsustainable tokenomics in play. Enforcing this cap fosters a stable token supply, instills long-term confidence in the project, and aligns the interests of all stakeholders.

### **Genuine Community Governance**

Factor is dedicated to promoting genuine community governance, where users' voices carry significant weight in shaping the protocol's development and trajectory. With over 80% of the $FCTR supply allocated to the community, we emphasize our trust in the collective wisdom and decision-making capabilities of an active community. We firmly believe that this strategy will drive DeFi innovation to unprecedented levels and nurture a collaborative ecosystem.

## **$veFCTR: Long-term Incentives and Anti-Whale Measures**

ðŸ’¡ When you stake $FCTR tokens, they are converted into locked $veFCTR. You can stake your tokens [here](https://app.factor.fi/governance/staking).

$veFCTR has multiple utilities that will be expanded in the future, such as:

* **Prevent Yield Mercenaries**: By requiring a commitment to lock tokens, $veFCTR discourages short-term speculators and promotes genuine long-term engagement with the protocol.
* **Anti-Whale Mechanism**: The conversion to $veFCTR helps to limit the influence of large token holders, ensuring a more balanced governance process.
* **Long-term Incentives**: $veFCTR holders are rewarded with 50% of all protocol fees, providing an ongoing incentive for long-term participation and support.
* **Governance Rights**: By holding $veFCTR, users gain the right to participate in Factor's governance decisions, ensuring that the community remains at the core of the project's evolution.
