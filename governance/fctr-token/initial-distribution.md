### FCTR Liquidity Provision (5%)

5,000,000 [FCTR](./#fctr) tokens were allocated as protocol-owned market making liquidity on Camelot V3 ([FCTR-USDC](https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0xc39D8c1F4e09133738A3f97C63C7E3300035d2bD), [FCTR-ETH](https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x90635Ddf0B7fB9AEB3d9De749b815374302DBbDe)). This ensured sufficient market depth for the buying and selling of FCTR on the open market. All tokens were fully unlocked since TGE.

### Ecosystem Incentives (15.8%)

15,800,000 [FCTR](./#fctr) tokens are designated as ecosystem incentives that are distributed to Factor users via mechanisms such as  [Factor Scale](../factor-scale/) and [Factor Boost](../factor-boost/). Through targeted use of FCTR tokens, the incentives are meant to bolster greater adoption and long-term engagement with the Factor platform. These tokens are linearly vested over 24 months.

### Community Bootstrapping (4.2%)

The community bootstrapping allocation represents 4,200,000 [FCTR](./#fctr) tokens, priced at $0.05, and subject to a 12 months linear vesting schedule with a 30-day cliff. No tokens were available at [Token Generation Event](./#at-a-glance) (TGE). This allocation supported smart contract audits, development, legal, and marketing efforts required for the platform's launch.

### Team (15%)

The team allocation amounts to 15,000,000 [FCTR](./#fctr) tokens and is subjected to a 24-month vesting period with a 30-day cliff.  Team allocation supports the development and operations of the Factor platform including product development as well as marketing/partnership initiatives.

No team tokens were available at [TGE](./#at-a-glance). Note that while team tokens are unvested, they do not accrue [veFCTR](./#vefctr). To accrue veFCTR, the tokens must be vested, claimed and staked, ensuring fair distribution and rewards for all ecosystem participants.

### Treasury Reserve (50%)

50,000,000 [FCTR](./#fctr) tokens were allocated to the [FactorDAO](../factordao/) Treasury Reserve, which is vested over 4 years. This reserve is used for FactorDAO contributor compensations (via [Factor Contributors](../../community/factor-contributors.md) program), DAO-to-DAO token swaps, and any other future needs of the FactorDAO. This allocation helps ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the Factor ecosystem.

## Emissions

[FCTR](./#fctr) reaches its full circulating supply of 100,000,000 tokens 4 years after [TGE](./#at-a-glance). The max supply is capped and there are no inflationary mechanisms beyond this.
