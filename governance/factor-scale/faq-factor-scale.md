# ‚ùî FAQ - Factor Scale

<details>

<summary>What is Factor Scale?</summary>

Factor Scale is a governance mechanism for [veFCTR](../fctr-token/#vefctr) holders, allowing them to vote on the allocation of Scale rewards to various strategies on a weekly basis.&#x20;

To ensure equitable distribution of emissions, Factor Scale implements TVL milestones whereby every subsequent TVL target achieved unlocks more [FCTR](../fctr-token/#fctr) rewards in the next epoch.

More info can be found on our [Factor Scale](./) Docs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do Scale reward mechanics work?</summary>

Stakeholders use their [veFCTR](../fctr-token/#vefctr) to vote on the allocation of weekly Scale rewards across different vaults. The rewards a vault receives depend on its share of the total votes. The mechanics involve:

* Higher [veFCTR](../fctr-token/#vefctr) holdings leading to increased individual rewards.
* Reward variance based on weekly voting outcomes.
* A multiplier effect on rewards for [veFCTR](../fctr-token/#vefctr) holders (e.g., a 2.5x multiplier depending on vault participation).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do weekly vault rewards vary?</summary>

Weekly vault rewards vary based on the outcomes of the [voting process](./#voting-process) as well as [emission milestones](./#fctr-emission-milestones), reflecting the community's consensus on which vaults should receive more or less of the total rewards.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is esFCTR and its vesting mechanism?</summary>

Scale rewards are distributed as [esFCTR](../fctr-token/#esfctr), which are non-transferable and non-tradeable. It can be converted to FCTR on a 1:1 ratio over a 90-day vesting period, aimed at reducing sell-pressure and promoting long-term engagement. Vesting can be claimed at any time based on total time vested and is irreversible once initiated.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there flexibility in claiming Scale rewards?</summary>

Yes, claiming rewards is flexible and can be done at any time, allowing stakeholders to choose when to receive their rewards.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there any benefits for non-veFCTR holders?</summary>

Non-veFCTR holders still receive rewards, but at a lower rate compared to [veFCTR](../fctr-token/#vefctr) holders.
