Stakeholders use their veFCTR to vote on the allocation of weekly Scale rewards across different vaults. The rewards a vault receives depend on its share of the total votes. The mechanics involve:

* Higher veFCTR holdings leading to increased individual rewards.
* Reward variance based on weekly voting outcomes.
* A multiplier effect on rewards for veFCTR holders (e.g., a 2.5x multiplier depending on vault participation).
