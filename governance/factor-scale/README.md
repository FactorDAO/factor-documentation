# ⚖ Factor Scale

## Overview

{% hint style="success" %}
**Factor Scale Rewards**

Factor will allocate 100,000 FCTR per epoch (weekly) over an initial period of 6 months for Factor Scale. The FCTR tokens for Scale rewards are sourced from the [Ecosystem Incentives  ](../fctr-token/initial-distribution.md#ecosystem-incentives-20.8)portion during FCTR initial distribution.
{% endhint %}

Factor Scale enables veFCTR holders to vote on the distribution of weekly gauge rewards to different vaults created on Factor. To incentivize greater user engagement and deeper liquidity, FactorDAO has allocated 100,000 FCTR per epoch (weekly) that is distributed to strategy Depositors as gauge rewards. veFCTR holders participate in a weighted voting mechanism that takes place weekly to determine the distribution of gauge rewards.&#x20;

Factor Scale therefore democratizes the allocation of protocol rewards via allowing veFCTR holders to direct protocol emissions through community voting. Rewards distributed by Scale are vested as esFCTR, which can be converted to FCTR at a 1:1 ratio over a 90-day vesting period.&#x20;

## Scale Weight

In addition to the veFCTR staking multiplier, Factor Scale utilizes a Scale Weight to further ensure the fair and efficient distribution of Scale rewards. The Scale Weight is a computed score which determines the final Scale reward allocation for each vault. To calculate the Scale Weight, Factor Scale takes into account the following considerations:

* **Vault TVL:** The total value locked in a strategy vault
* **Performance Factor:** A measure of vault's relative performance against other vaults.
* **Community Governance:** The proportion of votes which a vault received via Scale voting.

## Voting Process

To be eligible to vote on Scale rewards distribution, users must first stake FCTR to receive veFCTR which represents a single vote (i.e. 1 veFCTR: 1 vote). veFCTR holders are then able to vote for multiple strategies by allocating a percentage of their total veFCTR holdings towards various vaults.

Voting occurs per epoch (weekly) whereby veFCTR holders will have a 96 hour window to vote on their preferred vaults. This encourages greater participation by allowing ample time for votes to be cast. Following the voting window, Scale rewards are then proportionally distributed based on a vault's calculated Scale Weight.

Every step, from voting to reward distribution, is transparent and aligns with the community’s sentiment.
