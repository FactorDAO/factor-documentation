# üöÄ Factor Boost

## Overview

Factor Boost allows anyone to allocate any ERC20 token as additional rewards for depositors in a target strategy vault. This means that any Strategy Manager (i.e. protocols or individuals) that has a public strategy will be able to incentivize deposits through the ‚Äúboosting‚Äù of strategy yields via reward token distribution. Just select a target vault as well as a whitelisted ERC20 reward token and Factor Boost will automatically apportion the reward tokens to vault depositors.

**Reward Token Whitelisting**

For the whitelisting of reward tokens, please email [info@factor.fi](mailto:info@factor.fi) with your request (e.g.\[TOKEN WHITELIST]) and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
{% endhint %}

Factor Boost rewards are distributed linearly over the period of 7 days from when the reward tokens are deposited. The number of reward tokens allocated per block is then distributed proportionally based on the total deposits in the vault for the specified block. In cases where the target vault has an existing rewards schedule, any additional rewards added will be apportioned according to the remaining time of the first created rewards schedule. As Factor Boost matures, more advanced rewards scheduling options will be supported.

Factor Boost is currently available to our partners via the Factor dapp with public access coming very soon! While the concepts underlying Factor Boost has largely targeted protocols, the ease of creating vault reward schedules via the Factor dapp ensures equitable access to incentivization mechanics. Strategies which grow the Factor ecosystem might also receive additional boosts via [FCTR](fctr-token/#fctr) tokens disbursed by Factor.

**Factor Boost Incentive Matching Program**

Depending on the outcome of community votes, Factor will strive to match the value of the native tokens provided by our partners as boost rewards.

Please email [info@factor.fi](mailto:info@factor.fi) if you would like to submit your vault for the program (e.g.\[BOOST MATCHING]).
