#### Position Management

**Collateral Switching**: After setting up your leveraged position, adjust your strategy by seamlessly switching your collateral. This flexibility is key in managing market volatility and aligning with your risk appetite.

**Debt Switching**: Adapt to market changes by switching your debt asset. This feature allows you to change your borrowed asset to another, optimizing your position in response to fluctuating interest rates or market trends.

The dashboard provides real-time updates on crucial metrics like Loan to Value (LTV), liquidation thresholds, and health factors, enabling informed decision-making and risk assessments.

#### Refinancing

Optimize your leveraged positions by tapping into the most favorable market conditions across various lending protocols.

Refinancing can be a critical tool for risk management, allowing you to shift your position to more stable or profitable protocols as market dynamics change. By moving to protocols with better terms, you can improve the overall health of your leveraged position, optimizing your LTV ratios, and potentially avoid liquidation scenarios.
